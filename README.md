## “What’s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?”
I believe that it is identical aside from the fact that its missing the assets folder its also missing the java script function which we did in lab 5 i think but other than that it works just like lab 4 and I see no differences. If you're asking how its hosted? I'd say that theyre both on local hosts. I dont know the difference between opening lab 4 with live server and doing this lab with hono?










```
npm install
npm run dev

```
open http://localhost:3000
